EDA Summary: 
The training dataset contains 8,693 rows and 14 columns with various features related to passengers on a spacecraft, such as their age, destination, services used, and more. The dataset has a mix of numerical and categorical variables. There are missing values in several columns, with percentages ranging from 0.00% for 'Transported' to 2.49% for 'CryoSleep'. Some high-uniqueness columns like 'PassengerId', 'Cabin', and 'Name' have been dropped, likely due to their low predictive power or privacy concerns.

There are no constant columns, meaning no column has the same value across all rows. However, there are 2,266 duplicate rows that may need to be addressed, possibly by removing duplicates or aggregating them based on specific criteria.

For the numeric features (Age, RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck), skewness and kurtosis are not provided, suggesting they might have been calculated but not included in the summary. Boxplots show that these variables have significant outliers, which could impact model performance if not handled properly.

The correlation analysis reveals weak to moderate correlations between some numeric features, such as Age and RoomService, FoodCourt and VRDeck. This suggests that these features might be influencing each other to some extent.

The categorical columns include 'HomePlanet', 'CryoSleep', 'Destination', and 'VIP', which have been encoded using one-hot encoding for HomePlanet and Destination, and label encoding for CryoSleep and VIP. The most frequent values for these columns are: Earth for HomePlanet, False for CryoSleep, TRAPPIST-1e for Destination, and False for VIP.

After preprocessing, the final processed dataset has a shape of (8,693, 15), with 15 columns including the encoded categorical variables. This cleaned and transformed dataset is ready for further analysis, feature selection, and model building.

Performing standardization.

########################### results ################################### 

The performed feature engineering transformations can be described as follows:

1. No change: Some columns, such as CryoSleep, Age, VIP, RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck, Transported, and the HomePlanet and Destination columns, remain unchanged. These columns likely represent categorical or numerical features that were considered adequate for modeling without further modification.

2. Squared values: Columns with "_Squ" suffix, like Age_Squ, indicate that the original Age feature has been squared. Squaring a numerical feature can help capture nonlinear relationships between the feature and the target variable.

3. Log transformation: There are no explicit columns with "_log" suffix in the provided list, so it's possible that no log transformation was applied to any of the original features. If a log transformation had been used, it would have been applied to a numerical feature (like Age or some spending amount) to reduce the impact of extreme values and potentially normalize the distribution.

4. Cubed values: The presence of a column named Age_cubed suggests that the original Age feature has been cubed, similar to the squared transformation. This further emphasizes nonlinearity in the relationship between age and the target variable.

5. Multiplication: The column VIP*Destination might indicate that the VIP feature has been multiplied by one of the destination features (likely a binary indicator for each destination). This could create an interaction term, capturing the combined effect of being a VIP and traveling to a specific destination on the target variable.

6. Missing value indicators: Columns with "_missing" suffix, such as Age_missing, suggest that binary flags have been created to indicate whether a particular value is missing for that feature. This helps the model account for missing data by treating it as a separate category.

In summary, the transformations include squaring and cubing numerical features to capture nonlinearity, creating interaction terms, and indicating missing values for better handling during model training.No changes to the dataset where made.
starting Model Selection
🏆 Best Model Identified: Based on the provided information and the guidelines, the best model for this binary classification problem would be **Random Forest**. It typically outperforms logistic regression and decision trees in terms of predictive accuracy, while still offering good interpretability. Moreover, it handles high-dimensional data well and is less prone to overfitting, which is beneficial given the moderate sample size (8693 instances).
